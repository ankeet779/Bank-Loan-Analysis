📊 Bank Loan Analysis: Power BI vs. MySQL
📝 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bank loans, focusing on loan approvals, repayments, defaults, and borrower profiles. The goal is to compare results obtained from MySQL queries and Power BI dashboards, highlighting insights into lending patterns, risk assessment, and financial trends.

🎯 Objective
Analyze bank loan data using SQL (MySQL) and Power BI.

Compare query-based vs. visual-based insights.

Identify key loan performance indicators (KPIs).

Track good vs. bad loans, borrower risk profiles, and trends.

📌 Problem Statement
The Bank Loan Report is designed to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities by evaluating:
✔ Total Loan Applications (Monthly & Overall)
✔ Total Funded Amount (Loans Disbursed)
✔ Total Amount Received (Repayments)
✔ Average Interest Rate (Portfolio-wide)
✔ Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) (Borrower Risk Analysis)
✔ Good Loans vs. Bad Loans (Based on Loan Status)
✔ Loan Status Grid View (Categorized Loan Data)

🔍 Data Insights & Dashboards
